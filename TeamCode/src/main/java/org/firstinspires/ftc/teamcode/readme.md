## Hello

Hi, I'm Makani from Team MEAF #16374. I'm going to test out the NavX Micro sensor for FTC but it might never be finished. I hope you all enjoy :)

## Updates

May 11, 2023: Removed the InitSetup class due to multiple errors. Managed to get the controllers working.

May 5, 2023: Fixed some problems in the old code due to there being multiple problems during the initialization and TeleOp stages.

April 28, 2023: I first created all of the test codes and set the hardware components. I also created a test code for Field Centric Drive to utilize the sensor.
                I uploaded the library of the NavX sensor under FtcRobotController/java because I had too much trouble trying to upload it the way Kauai Labs recommended it.
